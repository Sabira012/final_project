# Final Project for the Coding for Economists Course

## Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for my coding course. The project demonstrates my skills in data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis using both Stata and Python.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is a cleaned version of a used car sales dataset.

## Analysis
- Data cleaning and preparation were done in both Stata and Python.
- Summary statistics and visualizations (histogram of price distribution) were created.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sabira012/final_project.git
2. Run the Stata `.do` files from the `scripts/stata` folder.
3. Run the Python script `data_analysis.py` from the `scripts/python` folder.
